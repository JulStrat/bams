# BAMS - binary array multi set

One of my favorite data structures, 
described in [Introduction to Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Algorithms), 
chapter 17 "Amortized Analysis", problem 17-2 "Making binary search dynamic".

Name BAS - "binary array set" was made by [Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/binary-array-set).
